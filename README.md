## About the Project
Assistive Vision AI is a computer vision application built to assist visually impaired individuals by detecting and recognizing critical environmental cues such as:
- Street signs
- Crosswalks
- Traffic lights
- Stairs
- Warning/danger signs

The system provides **real-time audio feedback** to alert users of important surroundings, enabling safer and more independent navigation in urban environments.

---

## Features
- **Real-time object detection** for essential navigation cues
- **Text detection (OCR)** for reading street and facility signs
- **Audio feedback system** for immediate alerts
- Built with **deep learning** and **computer vision**
- Modular code structure for easy updates and expansions

---

## Tech Stack
- **Programming Language:** Python

- **Frameworks & Libraries:**  
  - PyTorch / YOLO  
  - OpenCV  
  - EasyOCR / Tesseract OCR  

- **Data Handling:** The dataset was created and annotated using [Roboflow](https://roboflow.com), which provided tools for:
- Collecting and organizing images
- Annotating bounding boxes for target classes
- Automatically splitting into train/validation/test sets
- Exporting in YOLO-compatible format

- **Audio Output:** pyttsx   
- **Model Management:** Git LFS (for large files)

- **Deployment:** (Planned) Streamlit / Mobile App
